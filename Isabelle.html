    <div>Isabelle is a golden-coloured Shih Tzu, originally named Shizue in Japanese.<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/26/Isabelle_AF.png" style="float: left;">The development team of New Leaf created her after deciding that the player-controlled mayor needed an assistant. They focused on making a "very affectionate" character who was loyal and helpful, and thus chose to make a female dog who was "a little bit clumsy... but still very cute". Animal Crossing designers wanted players to reject Isabelle's offer of a ceremony for various accomplishments as mayor at least once so that they feel bad about having done so.</div>
