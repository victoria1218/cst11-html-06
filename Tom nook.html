    <p> <li><h2 style="font-family: fantasy;">Nook</h2>Tom Nook, known in Japan as Tanukichi (たぬきち), is a fictional character in the Animal Crossing series who operates the village store (or the Resident Services building in Animal Crossing: New Horizons). He first appeared in the Nintendo 64 game Dōbutsu no Mori, released in Europe and North America on the GameCube as Animal Crossing. Nook sells a house to the player at the beginning of each title in the series (with Animal Crossing: New Leaf and Animal Crossing: New Horizons being an exception, as Nook sells the player a tent at the start of those games), giving a set mortgage for them to pay, and offering to upgrade it after the mortgage is paid off.
