    <p>
        Snooty is a female villager personality type in the Animal Crossing series. Snooty villagers are portrayed as self-centered and arrogant, and in earlier games they are dismissive toward the player.
        <br>

As of the release of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, there are a total of 67 snooty villagers across the series 57 appear in New Horizons.<img src="https://dodo.ac/np/images/5/56/Ankha_NH.png" style="float: left; width: 150px; height: 280px;">
<br>Snooty villagers are well-spoken and polite, but sometimes appear self-centered and arrogant towards other villagers, including the player. In Animal Crossing: New Leaf, they speak with a lower-pitched and sophisticated, <br>
almost charming voice, which sounds similar to the voices used by smug villagers. Animal Crossing: New Horizons gives them a soft and sophisticated voice similar to the normal villagers, but at a lower pitch. If the player talks to them often, they open up and become more talkative,
<br>and will sometimes give the <img src="https://dodo.ac/np/images/thumb/9/97/CF_Olivia_%26_Biskit.jpg/480px-CF_Olivia_%26_Biskit.jpg" style="float: right; width:300px; height: 190;"> lessons in fashion. However, this doesn't prevent them from making the occasional scathing comment. Snooty villagers usually have upper-class names, or names relating to high-value items and gemstones, making them easy to distinguish when talking to villagers around the town. 
<br>In Animal Crossing: New Leaf and Animal Crossing: New Horizons, the arrogant nature of snooty villagers is toned down.
