        Big sister,also known colloquially as uchi or sisterly, is a female villager personality type in the Animal Crossing series introduced in Animal Crossing: New Leaf. Big sister villagers are initially portrayed as stubborn and rude, though they open up and act like an older sister to the player as they befriend them.

<br>    As of the release of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, there are a total of 26 big sister villagers across the series, making it the least common personality; all 26 appear in New Horizons. <img src="https://dodo.ac/np/images/thumb/6/67/Fuchsia_NH.png/127px-Fuchsia_NH.png" style="float: right;">

<br>In New Leaf, big sister <img src="https://dodo.ac/np/images/thumb/1/16/Muffy_NH.png/155px-Muffy_NH.png" style="float: left;">cannot be one of the starting villagers in the player's town. In New Horizons, a big sister villager is always one of the two starting villagers on the player's island.
<br>Big sister villagers are often depicted as stubborn, rude, and easily offended at first glance, in a similar manner to cranky villagers, who also have a hostile behavior. Big sister villagers also speak with gruff, accented voices, similar to the deep voices cranky villagers use, in reference to their "tough" attitudes. As a result of this, they are seen as a sort of tomboy, as they occasionally talk about enjoying fighting, and express an interest in participating in "turf wars." 
<br>In addition to this, they might give the player a petition called "Tomboys Are People Too" which further supports this. Despite this tough exterior, however, big sister villagers are kind and empathetic deep down. <img src="https://dodo.ac/np/images/thumb/e/ef/Renée_NH.png/129px-Renée_NH.png" style="float: left;" >may act like an older sister when befriended, and may even give the player medicine (or in New Horizons, <br>
the DIY recipe for it) if talked to after being stung by bees or wasps.

The personality is likely derived from the behavior of peppy islanders in Animal Crossing and Doubutsu no Mori e+, specifically Elina, Flossie, and Plucky, <br>alongside Charlise, Koharu, and Violet in e+, who behave similarly to the big sister villagers. However, only Charlise and Plucky return with the big sister personality, with the rest of the peppy islanders not appearing in any other Animal Crossing game other than the First generation games.
