        <p>
            Peppy is a female villager personality type in the Animal Crossing series. Peppy villagers are portrayed as energetic, excited, and ditzy, embodying the valley girl stereotype.

<br>As of the release of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, there are a total of 66 peppy villagers across the series; 53 appear in New Horizons.<img src="https://dodo.ac/np/images/thumb/6/67/Rosie_NH.png/250px-Rosie_NH.png" style="float: left; width: 176px; height: 250px;">
<br>Peppy villagers are energetic, friendly, and overly excited, allowing them to get along easily with many villagers. In Animal Crossing: New Leaf, they speak with chipper, bouncy voices and enjoy cheering when talking with players and other villagers; they are rarely discouraged from doing anything. 
<br>They come out of their homes often and are always excited to see the player. <img src="https://dodo.ac/np/images/thumb/b/b3/CF_Tutu_Moxie.png/480px-CF_Tutu_Moxie.png" style="float: right;"> have short attention spans, making them forget easily, and wild imaginations, which may sometimes lead them to unintentionally gossip about other villagers.

<br>They often use stereotypical valley girl phrases like "ohmigosh!!!" and "like" (as in, "That is, like, so cool!"). When they are describing certain things, they often use "SOOOO" and "totally!" Their ambition is to be popular or famous, claiming letters sent by the player as "fan mail" and are jealous when the player is the center of attention,
<br> claiming it to be their job. In New Horizons, peppy villagers will also sometimes say "tr√®s" (French for "very") in their dialogue, and tend to be excited on days when K.K. Slider appears on the island. They also love to talk about becoming a recording star, saying phrases like "Want to practice being pop stars together?".
