        <p>"He might seem scary at first, but he's actually a big softy, even if he tries to act all serious!"

â€” Isabelle, talking about a cranky villager, Animal Crossing: New Leaf<img src="https://dodo.ac/np/images/thumb/2/28/Apollo_NH.png/250px-Apollo_NH.png" style="float: right;">
<br>Cranky is a male villager personality type in the Animal Crossing series. Cranky villagers are portrayed as bitter, rude, and stubborn.

As of the release of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, there are a total <img src="https://dodo.ac/np/images/b/b4/WW_Chief.png" style="float: left;" 65 cranky villagers across the series;[nb 1] 57 appear in New Horizons.

<br>Cranky villagers typically act quite bitter, rude, and stubborn, being angered easily if things are not going their way (hence the name "cranky"). <br>They are also, generally, out-of-touch with social trends, making them generally unpopular with the peppy villagers. They are all deep-voiced (unlike every other villager) and many have frowns.

<br>In Animal Crossing and Doubutsu no Mori e+, the cranky islanders of Animal Island, which include Flash, O'Hare (until New Leaf), and Rowan (until Wild World), alongside Curlos (until New Leaf), Frank, and Weldon in e+, act suave, polite, romantic, and gentlemanlike, if a bit arrogant, in a similar manner to the smug personality introduced in Animal Crossing: New Leaf, often trying to woo the player,
<br> though are slightly more old-fashioned. However, only Curlos and O'Hare return with this personality.
