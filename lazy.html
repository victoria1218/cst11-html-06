    <div>Lazy is a male villager personality type in the Animal Crossing series. Lazy villagers have a relaxed, laid-back lifestyle and appear friendly toward the player. They often talk about food and are humorous or naïve during conversations.</p>
    <p>Lazy villagers have a relaxed and laid-back approach to living in the town unlike the normal meaning, not being bothered by homework <img src="https://dodo.ac/np/images/7/7b/PC_Bob_45_Minutes.png" width=150px; height=300px; style="float: right;">or chores and doing laid-back things. <br>They appear somewhat goofy or naïve, in the way they speak and talk about hobbies, particularly fashion. Often, they will have dreamed up an "alter ego" of Fashion Lad. <br>In Animal Crossing: Wild World, they may mention reading an unseen magazine, called "Chillin' Magazine," which also reflects on their chilled, relaxed lifestyle. <br>In New Horizons, they frequently mention that they talk to and make friends with bugs, including some that have apparently infested their houses. <br>Because of this, in New Horizons, they are the only personality type that will not respond with disgust upon seeing a Cockroach in a player's house. 
        <br>However, they will still immediately leave, citing various reasons like not preparing for a cockroach party.

        <br>They often mention theories relating to certain aspects of the town, which they will mention in conversation to the player or other villagers. 
        <br>For example, some lazy villagers will wonder aloud who has to sit inside the Tom Nook Point System to make it talk, suggest that Tom Nook's store has a basement filled with Tom Nook stuffed animals, or posit that they are part of a game for someone else's amusement (but then claim it was a joke).<br> In some games, they may express a fascination with Tom Nook's fluffy tail.</p></div>
