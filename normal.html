            Normal,also known as sweet,is a female villager personality type in the Animal Crossing series. Normal villagers are portrayed as sweet and friendly, and they often have an interest in reading or cooking.

        <br>As of the release of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, there are a total of 75 normal villagers across the series;<img src="https://dodo.ac/np/images/5/54/Margie_NH.png" style="float: right;">63 appear in New Horizons.
        <br>Normal villagers, despite being called "normal," are known for their sweet demure and naivete. Some common interests they have are reading or cooking, and often discuss what they read with the player. In this respect, they are the female counterpart to lazy villagers. Normal villagers, due to their "normal" nature,
        <br> often see themselves as the only "sane" people in the town, as all <img src="https://dodo.ac/np/images/thumb/6/64/PC_Ava_Traveling_Bookstore.png/300px-PC_Ava_Traveling_Bookstore.png" style="float: left;" width=200px; height=287px;>other personalities are exaggerated stereotypes of real-life personalities.

        <br>In Animal Crossing and Doubutsu no Mori e+, the normal islanders of Animal Island, which include Caroline (Bliss in Animal Crossing), Faith (until New Horizons), and June, plus Marina, Norma, and Patricia in e+, are fanciful and nature-loving hippies. 
        <br>They act down-to-earth in their speech, stating various "blessings" of the island and its surrounding landscape. They are also much more airheaded and childish, dreaming of living in fairy tales or
         at how "magical" a piece of furniture is. They are more prone to daydreaming and having peculiar thoughts than their mainland counterparts. 
        <br>They are very rarely (if at all) angry and tend to take insults and disappointment easily, but will apologize even though they may not have done anything wrong.
